      Rotary International is an international service organization whose stated
      purpose is to bring together business and professional leaders in order to
      provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all
      vocations, and to advance goodwill and peace around the world. It is a
      non-political and non-sectarian organization open to all people regardless
      of race, color, creed, religion, gender, or political preference. There
      are 34,282 member clubs worldwide. 1.2 million individuals called
      Rotarians have joined these clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rotarians usually gather weekly for breakfast, lunch, or dinner to fulfill
      their first guiding principle to develop friendships as an opportunity for
      service. "It is the duty of all Rotarians," states their Manual of
      Procedure[2] "outside their clubs, to be active as individuals in as many
      legally constituted groups and organizations as possible to promote, not
      only in words but through exemplary dedication, awareness of the dignity
      of all people and the respect of the consequent human rights of the
      individual." The Rotarian's primary motto is "Service Above Self"; its
      secondary motto is "One profits most who serves best."

    <h4>What is Rotaract?</h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      Rotaract originally began as a Rotary International youth program in
      1968[2] at Charlotte North Rotary Club in Charlotte, North Carolina,
      United States, and has grown into a major Rotary-sponsored organization of
      over 9,522 clubs spread around the world and 291,006 members. It is a
      service, leadership, professional and community service organization
      (often miscommunicated as a Social Service Club) for young men and women
      between the ages 18–30
    </p>
    <p>
      Rotaract focuses on the development of young adults as leaders in their
      communities and workplaces. Clubs around the world also take part in
      international service projects, in a global effort to bring peace and
      international understanding to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rotaract" stands for "Rotary in Action", although the name originally
      comes from a combination of "Rotary" and "Interact" (International +
      Action), the high school level program created by Rotary International in
      1962
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Rotaract activities take place at the club level. Rotaract clubs hold
      formal meetings, usually every two weeks, which feature speakers, special
      outings, social activities, discussions or visits to other clubs. Club
      members get together on designated days for service project work, social
      events, or professional/leadership development workshops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of Rotaract is to provide an opportunity for young men and
      women to enhance the knowledge and skills that will assist them in
      personal development, to address the physical and social needs of their
      communities, and to promote better relations between all people worldwide
      through a framework of friendship and service. To be eligible for
      membership, prospective members must be 18–30 years of age, show that they
      are committed to Rotaract, and show that they are of good standing in the
      community. After being approved by the club, prospective members are
      'inducted' to become members, also known as 'Rotaractors'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The avenues of service include Club Service, Community Service,
      International Service and Professional Development.
