    <h2>Our Causes</h2>
    <br />
    <h4> Promoting peace</h4>
    <p>
      Rotary encourages conversations to foster understanding within and across
      cultures. We train adults and young leaders to prevent and mediate
      conflict and help refugees who have fled dangerous areas.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Fighting disease</h4>
    <p>
      We educate and equip communities to stop the spread of life-threatening
      diseases like polio, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. We improve and expand access
      to low-cost and free health care in developing areas.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Providing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene</h4>
    <p>
      We support local solutions to bring clean water, sanitation, and hygiene
      to more people every day. We donâ€™t just build wells and walk away. We
      share our expertise with community leaders and educators to make sure our
      projects succeed long-term.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Saving mothers and children</h4>
    <p>
      Nearly 6 million children under the age of five die each year because of
      malnutrition, poor health care, and inadequate sanitation. We expand
      access to quality care, so mothers and their children can live and grow
      stronger.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Supporting education</h4>
    <p>
      More than 775 million people over the age of 15 are illiterate. Our goal
      is to strengthen the capacity of communities to support basic education
      and literacy, reduce gender disparity in education, and increase adult
      literacy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Growing local economies</h4>
    <p>
      We carry out service projects that enhance economic and community
      development and create opportunities for decent and productive work for
      young and old. We also strengthen local entrepreneurs and community
      leaders, particularly women, in impoverished communities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Ending polio forever</h4>
    <p>
      Rotary has been working to eradicate polio for over 30 years, and our goal
      of ridding the earth of this disease is in sight. We started in 1979 with
      vaccinations for 6 million children in the Philippines. Today,
      Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the only countries where polio
      remains endemic.
